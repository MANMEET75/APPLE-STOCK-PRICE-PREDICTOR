# APPLE-STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTOR

For this Model, we have collected 12 years of the dataset from 
yahoofinance.com then After using all the Feature Engineering techniques. 
we have built and trained LSTM Recurrent Neural Network using Tensor 
Flow-Keras We have added LSTM layers (Long Short Term Memory). We 
have used some of the most useful data science libraries like NumPy, 
Pandas, and Matplotlib. We have generated the visualization. We collected 
the Apple Stock price dataset from 1 JAN 2010 to 20 JUN 2022 then we 
predicted the trend for the Whole month of JULY 22 and as you can see we 
got an almost similar pattern
